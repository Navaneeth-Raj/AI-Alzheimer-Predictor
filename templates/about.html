                <h2>Understanding Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
                <p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die. It is the most common cause of dementia â€” a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that affects a person's ability to function independently.</p>
                
                <p>The early signs of the disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. As the disease progresses, a person with Alzheimer's disease will develop severe memory impairment and lose the ability to carry out everyday tasks.</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> While there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, medications may temporarily improve or slow the progression of symptoms. Early detection and lifestyle interventions can help manage the condition more effectively.</p>

                <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. The importance of these factors in increasing or decreasing the risk varies between individuals.</p>
                
                <ul class="risk-list">
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Increasing age is the greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Family history and genetics:</strong> Your risk increases if a first-degree relative has the disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Down syndrome:</strong> Many people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Head injuries:</strong> Some studies link serious head injuries with an increased risk of Alzheimer's.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor sleep patterns:</strong> Studies have shown a connection between poor sleep and higher levels of beta-amyloid, a protein found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle and heart health:</strong> The same factors that put you at risk of heart disease can also increase the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's.</li>
